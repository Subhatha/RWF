##Frontend:
React Native 

React Navigation (Stack.Navigator).

React Hooks (useState, useEffect) 

React Native Components - View, Text, ScrollView, TouchableOpacity, ActivityIndicator, and TextInput.

React Native Stylesheet → Used StyleSheet.create for styling.

##Backend & Database:
Firebase Authentication → For user authentication (firebase.auth().currentUser).

Firebase Firestore → For storing and retrieving user data (firebase.firestore().collection('users')).

Firebase SDK for React Native → To integrate Firebase services.

##State Management & Logic:
useState → To manage component states (e.g., workoutPlans, loading, error).

useEffect → For fetching user data on component mount.

Other Technologies & Features:
Expo (Possibly) → Since you're using Snack Expo for development.

JavaScript (ES6/ESNext) → Modern JS features like async/await, object destructuring, and arrow functions.

Firestore Querying → Used .doc(user.uid).get() to fetch user-specific data.

Custom Workout Logic → Based on body type, height, weight, and gender.

Potential Add-ons (If Needed)
Redux / Context API (If you later need global state management).

AsyncStorage or Firestore Realtime Database (If you want offline storage or live updates).
